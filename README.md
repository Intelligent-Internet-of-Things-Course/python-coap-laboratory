# Python - Laboratory CoAP

This project is associated to the CoAP Laboratory in order to design and create a simple CoAP application emulating
an IoT scenario where a CoAP client interacts with a CoAP Coffee Machine in order to:

- Read Temperature (GET Request)
- Read the presence of a Capsule in the machine (GET Request)
- Make a default Coffee (POST Request)
- Make a custom Coffee (Short, Medium, Long) (PUT Request)

The project use the Python Library AioCoAP that can be installed and imported through PyCharm or the pip install command.
